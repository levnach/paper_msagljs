\begin{abstract}
  There has been progress in visualization of large graphs recently. Still, interacting with a large graph in the browser with the same ease as browsing an online map, inspecting the high level structure and zooming to the lower details, is still an unsolved problem, in our opinion. In this paper we describe MSAGLJS's approach to two aspects of this problem. Firstly, we give a novel algorithm for edge routing, where the edges do not overlap the nodes. The algorithm does not necesserely creates optimal paths but is efficient and creates visually appealing paths.

  Secondly, to facilitate graph vizualization with DeckGL, we propose a new simple and efficient approach to tiling. The approch guarantees that in every view the number of visible entities is not larger than a predefined bound.

\section*{Edge routing}
The edge routing starts, as in~\cite{dwyer2010fast}, by building a spanner graph, an approximation of the full visibility graph. The spanner, see Fig.~\ref{fig:spanner}, is built on a variation of a Yao graph, which was introduced independently by Flinchbaugh and Jones~\cite{flinchbaugh1981strong}  and Yao~\cite{yao1982constructing}. This kind of graph is defined by the set of cones with the apices at the vertices. The cones have the same angle, usually in the form of $\frac{2\pi} {n}$, where $n$ is a natural number, and.  The family of cones with the apex at a specific vertex partition the plane as illistrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:yao}. For each cone at most one edge is created connecting the cone apex with a vertex inside of the cone, so the graph has $O(n)$ edges where $n$ is the number of vertices. \\

    \caption{\small{Spanner graph is built using the idea of Yao graphs. The dashed curves are the original node boundaries. Each original curve is surrounded by a polygon with some offset to allow the polyline paths smoothing without intersecting the former. \\
        The edge marked by the circles is created because the top vertex is inside of the cone and it is the closest among such vertices to the cone apex. The apex of the cone is the lower vertex of the edge. \\MSAGLJS uses cone angle $\frac{\pi}{6}$, so the edges of the spanner can deviate from the optimal direction by this angle. Therefore, the shortest paths on the spanner have length that is at most the optimal shortest length multiplied by $\frac{1}{\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})} \simeq 1.155$.}
    }
    \label{fig:spanner}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The approach of~\cite{dwyer2010fast} first builds a polyline path through the spanner, then applies some local modifications to shorten and smoothen the path. It tries to shortcut a vertex iteratively, as illustrated in Fig~\ref{fig:shortcut}. To smoothen it fits Bezier segments into the polyline corners, using the binary search to find the larger fitting segments,see Fig~\ref{fig:cornerfit}. While anylyzing performance of edge routing in MSAGLJS, we noticed that for a graph with more than 100O nodes these heuristics sometimes create a performance bottleneck in spite of using R-Trees\cite{guttman1984r}.

    \caption{Fitting a Bezier segment into a polyline corner}
    \label{fig:cornerfit}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\\
In addition, when the naive shortcutting of polyline corners fails,  the resulting path is not visually appealing, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:shortcut}.

We replace these heuristics with a more precize optimization.
\subsection*{Path optimization} {
Remember that a simple polygon is a polygon without holes.

The application of the 'path in a simple polygon' optimization is not a new approach. The authors of~\cite{dobkin1997implementing} used it, but only for hierarchical layouts, where a simple polygon, \plg, containing the path is available. They write: "If \plg~does not contain holes ... we can apply a standard “funnel” algorithm \cite{chazelle1982theorem,hershberger1994computing} for finding Euclidean shortest paths in a simple polygon". In general case, for a non-layered layout, they build the visibility graph which is very expensive.

Here we show how to build polygon \plg, and create a better path, for any layout. Let us describe our method.

We call obstacles $\mathcal{O}$~the set of polygons covering the original nodes, see Fig.~\ref{fig:spanner}. Before routing edges we calculate a Constrained Delaunay Triangulation~\cite{delaunay1934sphere} on $\mathcal{O}$ and call it $\mathcal{T}$. Then for each edge of the graph we proceed with the following steps.

We route a path on the spanner, as illistrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:non_opt_path_L}. Let us call this path \unpath.
\begin{figure}[!tbp]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{non_optimized_path_on_global_cdt.svg}
    \caption{Path \unpath~with \cdt, a fragment.}

  \end{minipage}
  \hfill

    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{poly2.svg}
    \caption{Polygon \plg~containing \unpath.}

  \end{minipage}
  \vfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{poly3.svg}
    \caption{New triangulation of \plg.}
    \label{fig:new_triangulation}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{poly4.svg}
    \caption{The optimized path together with the sleeve diagonals.}
    \label{fig:optimized_path}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the obstacle containing \unpath's start point, and $\mathcal{E}$ be the obstacle containing \unpath's end point.
To obtain \plg, let us consider \triset~, the set of all triangles ${t} \in \mathcal{T}$ such that
either ${t} \subset \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{E}$, or $t$ intersects \unpath~ and is not inside of any obstacle in $O \setminus \{S,E\}$  .
The union of \triset~gives us \plg. The boundary of \plg~comprizes all edges $e$ of the triangles from \triset~ such that $e$ is adjacent to exactly one triangle from \triset, see Fig.~\ref{fig:polygon_with_path}. \\
To apply the funnel algorithm~\cite{chazelle1982theorem,hershberger1994computing}, we need to have a triangulation of \plg~ such that every edge of the triangulation is either a boundary edge of \plg, or a diagonal of \plg. In our situation \triset~usually does not have this property. We create a new Constrained Delaunay Triangulation of \plg, where the set of constrained edges is the boundary of \plg, see Fig.~\ref{fig:new_triangulation}.\\
Finally, we apply the funnel algorithm with the new triangulation and obtain the path which is the shortest in the homotopy class of \unpath, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:optimized_path}.\\
\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics*[width=0.6\textwidth]{sleeve_diagonals_not_optimal.pdf}
  \caption{\plg~is not simple. The dotted path is shorter than the dashed one that was found by the routing.}
  \label{fig:non_optimal_path}
\end{figure}
The polygon \plg~is not neccesserely simple, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:non_optimal_path}.
In this example the path that we calculate with the funnel algorithm is not the shortest path inside of \plg.
\subsection*{Performance and quality comparison}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:improved_routing} we compare the paths generated by the old and the new method. We can see that the paths produced by the new method have no kinks. We also know that these paths are  the shorterst in their 'channels'. Arguably, the new method produces better paths.

Our performance experiments are summarized in Table.~\ref{tab:perf}. We see that the older approach outperforms the new one on the smaller graphs; those with the number of nodes under 2000. The new method is faster on the rest of the graphs. We still prefer to use the new method independently of the graph size since the total slowdown in insignificant, under a half second in our experiments, but the quality of the paths is better. On the larger graphs the new method runs faster and produces better paths, so it is an obvious choice.
